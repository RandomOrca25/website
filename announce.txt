Announcement thingy was made by HomeDragonjava (with pure pain)
If the server is not connecting, expect it to work tomorrow, maybe it's the router tweaking!!!
Guys, stop putting lead on your Chromebook USB port !1!1 You will cause a fire! AND EXPLODE YOU 
Server was down last night due to HomeDragonJava updating authme [login plugin] configuration, Turbo_orca is working on a fix
